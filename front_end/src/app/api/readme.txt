Model #1 - Abrupt Increase of BSW (sedament water)

This is an offline version of the model that runs locally, and includes all the required files.

Step 1 : Run the 'dependencies' batch file to install the needed libraries and proper versions.

Step 2 : Use 'prediction_output.txt' to display the results of the model

NOTE: The model is not set up with a variable for file input, you will need to open the python code (model1.py) and change the 'prediction_file' variable to = a var and not a hardcoded CSV. But, for testing purposes, you can use it as is to get it all working.

I think that's everything you'll need to know to get started, message me if you need more.
